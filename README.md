# Choose Your Own Adventure API

## Project Description

This project serves as an API backend for a Choose Your Own Adventure game. Players can create and update their state while traversing through different story elements. The API is built using [Your Technology Stack] and MongoDB as a database.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Make
- [Other technologies]

## Docker Setup

First, ensure that Docker is installed and you are logged in. If you are using Windows, please enable WSL2 for optimal performance.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root directory.

2. Build the Docker image.
    ```bash
    docker build -t cyoa-api .
    ```
3. Run the Docker container.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 cyoa-api
    ```

You should now have the API running at `localhost:8080`.

## Makefile Commands

Use Makefile commands for development purposes. Below are some commonly used commands:

- **build**: Compile the project
    ```bash
    make build
    ```
- **test**: Run all tests
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

## API Endpoints

Refer to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification file for details on API endpoints and request-response structures.

## Troubleshooting

If you are not able to insert data into MongoDB when creating a player state or story elementr, ensure that:

- MongoDB is running and accessible.
- The context timeout in the handler functions is appropriately set.
